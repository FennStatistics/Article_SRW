Soft Robot Walker could potentially open up new areas of development, which are so far untapped, and for which traditional robots may be unsuitable, or too expensive.

The basic system, as outlined here with this prototype, could be expanded upon and developed considerably, producing further sustainable economic growth.","reflection_social":"The construction of the robots will necessitate workers, which generate income, which is a desirable social outcome. The ability to produce robots via the use of home-based technology, such as 3D-printers, enables individuals to download schematics, which they can they build themselves, for a variety of purposes, also. To a degree this democratizes the process, allowing access to the robots, something which is not possible to any great degree with traditional robots.","reflection_ecological":"The Soft Robot Walker is constructed from relatively inexpensive materials, and due to its structure, should last a long time, requiring little maintenance, and infrequent replacement. It is not likely to be superceded by new models every 2-3 years, such as other forms of modern technology, such as smartphones, so in theory a robot could be functioning properly for a lengthy period. It also is a low energy using technology, completly unlike most other devices of its type. All of these factors make it ideal for a world in which climate sustainabily will be key going forward.","":"","ended_on":"form

The barrier to entry for the soft robot is much lower, you can start with an affordable 3D printer.

Because the components of these robots are soft, the maintenance is lower as parts will break less often.","reflection_social":"They may relate to social sustainability because they are a lot safer than traditional robots, which can often be secured inside a cage to prevent injuries. I imagine a soft robot would also be a bit less intimidating to work around, which is a psychological benefit. They could improve the quality of life of people in healthcare. Because the costs of soft robots is much lower it makes the opportunity a lot more widely available to people who could not normally take advantage of the technology.

The result of this is that humans should not have to conduct as many hazardous tasks in the future.

educational institutions and private homes have or have access to 3D printers and thus may utilise soft robotic tools in the sphere of education at a modest cost which has the advantage of democratising robotics and uses.\nSituations unhealthy for humans may utilise soft robotics as a cost and energy efficient platform to engage at reduced risk.\nThe materials used in 3D printing vary considerably in application suitability and where possible biodegradable materials may be used to the benefit of all.","reflection_economic":"Soft robots are potentially suitable for a great number of situations though clearly not all. In many cases the use of soft robots would be the most suitable choice, more suitable that is than hard robots or humans. One extremely important aspect of this is that models may be cheaply and iteratively prototyped until a final design is achieved. This results in much faster development at great pace and in a very resource efficient manner. The early prototypes can be developed possibly using cheap materials and later designs using materials with desired characteristics thus making the process even more cost efficient. Normally economy is achieved by scale, with soft robotics that is not quite so true. The choice of soft materials and compressed air is hugely important in reducing the harm to Earth. ","reflection_ecological":"Metals and in particular electronics as well as electricity production are harmful, mining, refining, transport, the whole process is harmful. The use of soft materials is generally very much less harmful and reduces the need to harm the planetary ecosystem to meet the objectives. If we do not have to damage systems they remain more tightly integrated as they should. When we ruin a system the benefits of full integration are much reduced or lost. Minimising harm to the planet is a truly worthwhile objective benefitting all.","":"","ended_on":"form

It is not restricted to particular environments so can help humans in explosive or dangerous environments as well as on many surfaces so can be used around the world. The robot has a modular design which can be 3D printed at home and added to for more complexity, allowing humans to adapt it to their requirements and cheaply print from home. But if they are not rich enough to own a 3D printer or have no access to the internet this feature will be useless, so is not equitable. The robot is more long lasting than rigid robots so requires less repair, maintenance and money to keep it going which is good for all people. The robot is powered by air which is free to all.","reflection_ecological":"The soft robot will not cause damage to delicate living structures or ecosystems. However the video did not mention whether it can be made waterproof to work under the sea or at depth where human access is limited. The robot could carry a camera to investigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems without disrupting them, or help to rebuild habitats that are difficult for humans to reach. It could also carry injured animals to safety. Due to the tripod gait it is stable in all situations so is perfect for the unpredictable natural environment, but may be challenged by extremes of heat, cold or pressure.","reflection_economic":"The soft robot has many uses and is relatively cheap to build and use. It is easy to adapt and uses no energy which is great for the environment and could be developed for use in industry or healthcare allowing human economies to continue to grow despite environmental challenges. It will provide work for designers, engineers, occupational advisers, manufacturers, retailers and increase productivity where it is used, benefiting everyone. I am unsure that growth will be equitable as rich countries and rich people will be able to exploit the technology and poor people will fall further behind.","":"","ended_on":"form

However, I believe there is room to help offer employment and training opportunities related to production of this robot.","reflection_ecological":"The robot seems more ecologically sustainable, due to a move away from electricity and towards compressed air. This means that the robot would be significantly less polluting than producing carbon emissions, and could enable work in diverse ecological areas such as the Amazon. However, it would be crucial to ensure that the robot had parts that were sourced ethically and sustainably, and that the overall carbon footprint of producing the robot is lower than that of a similarly sized/functioning electric robot.","":"","ended_on":"form

were a few points during the video pointing to the expected higher economic sustainability aspect of soft robots: easier and less wasteful production; simpler raw materials; more modular design (the last would imply, I think, more exchangeability during models). Also, the soft robots appear well suited to a wider range of environments and tasks, so that fewer distinct models would be needed (here, I assume this higher efficiency translates to more economical and sustainable production). ","reflection_ecological":"Some of the points I made above apply here too, since higher economic sustainability would imply higher ecological sustainability (I think; I am not familiar with this distinction).

This can reduce the liklihood of injury resulting from human and robot interaction, protecting people's health. Furthermore, the soft robot is more accessible to the general public as it can be made using a 3D printer, rather than conventional robots which need specialised machinary and can be expensive.

Additionally, the soft robot is much more sustainable long-term, and is less likely to show signs of wear and tear compared to the conventional robot, meaning that each unit lasts longer before needing to be replaced. Also, units can be expanded and modified as desired, meaning that if the robot needs to be used for an additional purpose in the future it can be modified to accommodate this, rather than a new robot

Its reliance on compressed air instead of electricity reduces operational costs and energy consumption, making it more accessible for small-scale industries or educational institutions. The ability to 3D-print components at home or in decentralized settings encourages local manufacturing and reduces dependence on expensive, centralized production systems. This opens up opportunities for decent employment in emerging tech sectors and supports equitable growth by lowering barriers to entry for robotics development. Overall, the SRW aligns with long-term economic resilience by combining affordability, adaptability, and sustainable resource use.","reflection_social":"The Soft Robot Walker supports social sustainability by promoting safer and more inclusive human–robot interaction. Its soft, bio-inspired design reduces the risk of injury, making it suitable for use in healthcare, elder care, and educational settings where physical safety is paramount. The ability to handle delicate objects and adapt to diverse environments means it can assist people with varying needs, including those in underserved or high-risk communities. Additionally, its low-cost, modular construction makes it more accessible to institutions and individuals with limited resources, fostering broader participation in technological innovation and education. This inclusivity helps build more equitable and resilient societies.","reflection_ecological":"The Soft Robot Walker supports ecological sustainability by minimizing environmental impact through its design and operation. Its use of soft, air-filled materials instead of rigid, energy-intensive components reduces mechanical wear and energy consumption. The robot’s ability to function without electronics and rely solely on compressed air makes it suitable for sensitive or hazardous environments, lowering the risk of ecological disruption. Additionally, its modular structure and compatibility with low-cost 3D printing promote decentralized production, which can reduce transportation emissions and resource extraction. By mimicking biological systems and adapting to natural terrain, the SRW aligns with ecological principles that prioritize harmony with ecosystems and long-term resilience.","":"","ended_on":"form submission","duration":432927.8999999523,"time_run":567637,"time_render":567636.678,"time_show":567669.9,"time_end":1000597.7999999523,"time_commit":1000598.100000143,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T12:56:25.388Z","time_switch":1000603.796},{"sender":"TransitionToEvaluation","sender_type":"html.Form","sender_id":"10","":"","ended_on":"form submission","duration":10226.104000095394,"time_run":1000600.4000000954,"time_render":1000603.796,"time_show":1000603.796,"time_end":1010829.9000000954,"time_commit":1010830.2000000477,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T12:56:35.620Z","time_switch":1010837.128},{"para_countclicks":0,"sender":"EvaluateInformation_1","sender_type":"html.Page","sender_id":"11_0","evalInf-9":"5","evalInf-2":"6","evalInf-7":"5","evalInf-4":"6","evalInf-6":"5","evalInf-8":"5","evalInf-1":"6","evalInf-10":"6","evalInf-3":"6","evalInf-5":"5","":"","ended_on":"form submission","duration":33165.871999999974,"time_run":1010831.5,"time_render":1010837.128,"time_show":1010837.128,"time_end":1044003,"time_commit":1044003.4000000954,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T12:57:08.793Z","time_switch":1044003.794},{"sender":"EvaluateInformation_2","sender_type":"html.Form","sender_id":"11_1","excitingDesign":"6","entertainingDesign":"5","boringDesign":"2","usefulDesign":"7","unnecessaryDesign":"2","unimportantDesign":"2","excitingTopic":"6","entertainingTopic":"5","boringTopic":"2","usefulTopic":"7","unnecessaryTopic":"1","unimportantTopic":"1","":"","ended_on":"form submission","duration":79466.40600004769,"time_run":1044003.5,"time_render":1044003.794,"time_show":1044003.794,"time_end":1123470.2000000477,"time_commit":1123470.9000000954,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T12:58:28.261Z","time_switch":1123487.1},{"sender":"Evaluation Sequence","sender_type":"flow.Sequence","sender_id":"11","ended_on":"completion","duration":112633.07200004766,"time_run":1010831.4000000954,"time_render":1010837.128,"time_show":1010837.128,"time_end":1123470.2000000477,"time_commit":1123471.7000000477,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T12:58:28.262Z","time_switch":1123487.1},{"sender":"TransitionToBrainstorming","sender_type":"html.Form","sender_id":"12","":"","ended_on":"form submission","duration":14943.60000004759,"time_run":1123472,"time_render":1123470.564,"time_show":1123487.1,"time_end":1138430.7000000477,"time_commit":1138430.9000000954,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T12:58:43.221Z","time_switch":1138453.8},{"sender":"Task 3 – Application Cases","sender_type":"html.Form","sender_id":"13","":"","ended_on":"form submission","duration":130722.60000009532,"time_run":1138432.2999999523,"time_render":1138437.212,"time_show":1138453.8,"time_end":1269176.4000000954,"time_commit":1269176.600000143,"timestamp":"2025-12-17T13:00:53.967Z","time_switch":1269187.3},{"sender":"Task 4 – Rate Application Relevance","sender_type":"html.Form","sender_id":"14","rating-Disaster relief in collapsed buildings -

It could be cheap enough to use, and practical, in challenging environments, including parts of the world with degraded infrastructure or technological access.
